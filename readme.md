My name is Shane Ehlert.
My project is Pokemon Memory Card.
The languages i used for this game were jquery,javascript,css,sweet alert, and html.
The best experience i had was actually getting a functional game and styling it.
the worst experience was trying to get the logic of the functions needs to make it work.
if i had more time i would add some other sounds to the actual cards.
